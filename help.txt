To work on the tests, open a browser and visit http://localhost:{{port}}. Then,
edit the tests in the files in the tests/app directory, reloading your browser
to see whether the tests are passing.

Each test will look something like this:

    it("you should be able to return a truthy value", function() {
      // define a function for fn so that the following will pass
      expect(fn()).to.be.ok();
    });

In the case of the above test, you'd need to define a value for fn (by default,
fn is a function that does nothing):

    it("you should be able to return a truthy value", function() {
      // define a function for fn so that the following will pass
      fn = function() {
        return true;
      };
      expect(fn()).to.be.ok();
    });

For some tests, the instructions will be more involved; in those cases, the
inline comments should give you the details you need.
